```bash
./monitor.sh

View Specific Resources
To monitor specific resources, use the following command-line switches:
-cpu : Top 10 applications by CPU and memory usage
-network : Network monitoring (connections, packet drops, MB in/out)
-disk : Disk usage by mounted partitions
-load : System load average and CPU breakdown
-memory : Memory and swap usage
-process : Number of active processes and top 5 processes
-services : Status of essential services (sshd, nginx/apache, iptables)
Example = ./monitor.sh -cpu -memory -network

Requirements
